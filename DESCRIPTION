Title: RolDE: Robust longitudinal Differential Expression
Version: 1.0.0
Description: RolDE detects longitudinal differential expression between 
    two conditions in noisy high-troughput data. Suitable even for 
    data with a moderate amount of missing values.RolDE is a composite method, 
    consisting of three independent modules with different approaches
    to detecting longitudinal differential expression. The combination of 
    these diverse modules allows RolDE to robustly detect
    varying differences in longitudinal trends and expression levels in
    diverse data types and experimental settings.

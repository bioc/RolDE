#' The temporal type 1 diabetes (T1D) proteomics data on blood plasma protein expression of 11 children developing T1D and 10 matched controls of Liu et al.
#'
#' Liu et al. have measured the longitudinal blood plasma protein expression of 11 children
#' aged from 0.8 years to 14.4 years developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 10 matched healthy
#' controls. Nine longitudinal samples were collected for each child with the T1D cases
#' experiencing seroconversion and a clinical T1D diagnosis during the course of the study.
#' The data was preprocessed and normalized similarly to Liu et al; the reporter
#' ion intensities were first standardized to the reference sample, log2-transformed
#' and median normalized. Similar to Liu et al, only proteins with at least 2 individuals
#' from one treatment group and at least 7 timepoints without missing values, were
#' included in the analysis.
